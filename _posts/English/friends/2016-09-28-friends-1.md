# Introduction:

This series of posts are created by myself to expedite my enlish learning based on the approach I learned from Zhihu to test if the aurthor's techique is practical.

## Episode 1 

- a hump and a hairpiece

	A hump means his spine is curved not straight(ie. a humpback, a term not really used today). A hairpiece is like a wig, meaning the man might be balding. The wig is a mysterious, furry mammal residing on the heads of aging, bald man.

- Mr Potato Head 	

- a tie

- Aruba big lizzards
	He's trying to come up with some reason why Aruba wouldn't be a fun place for Rachel to go, so she feels better about missing her honeymoon. but the best thing he can come up with is "big lizzards".

- I will not take this abuse

- You look like you sleft with a hanger in your mouth.

- There is no snap in his turtle for two yeas.

	The slang here "no snap in his turtle" in this special small talk means "this guy is sexually impotent". The slang originates from desctription of snapping turtles which are known to attack or bite people aggressively. But a snapping turtle with no snap is impotent. So, we can also use this phrase to describe someone is powerless.

	Another video I found to be fun to me is about the comparison between a common snapping turtle and a aligator snappin turtle. They are wonderful creatures born with instinct to bite.

> Abraham Maslow:
"If one took a course or picked up a book on the psychology of learning, most of it would be besides the humansitic point. Most of it would present learning as the acquisition of associations, of skills and capacities that are external and not intrinsic  to the human character.

> External refers to Information, Internal refers to transformation.
