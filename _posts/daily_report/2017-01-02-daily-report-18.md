when the class in our package can not be accessed because of its location in another development package, you can just change the package statement in the head.(need to be modified)

For example:
package org.apache.spark.ml.seal.util

#spark version migration issue:

spark: 1.6.0 -> 2.0.1
Semi-private class org.apache.spark.Logging. We suggest you use slf4j directly.

You can't make yourself rich by putting others down
go do somehing productive by action not by your dirty mouth

Don't get in our way
    
generate sperating line:

	--- println("-" * 100)
