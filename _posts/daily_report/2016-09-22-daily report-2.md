# Meet a new attractive man
The man climbing a steep in the preface of today's blog is named as "Alex Honnald". He is one of the human beings living narrowly on the edge of death. His interest and job is free soloing, which is an exterme sport that only requires rock shoes and chalk bag without any other auxiliraries.
Lets take an vid overview of what he's been doing these years.

The viewers on Youtube described that they can barely finish watching the video because it looks so terror-striken that their palms are all sweaty. Alex Honnald admitted that there were too many times he had to face and overcome the fear of death which was rooted in our hearts.
But Alex is the real model of the words "Practice makes perfect". Now we can see between the cleavage sometimes he just lies his back on the rock and puts his legs against the wall to take a rest.

Stunning! His experience sounds so inspiring and motivational to me as to revoke my ethusiasm to work beyond human limits in a steady healthy way.
